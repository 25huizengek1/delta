# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent stable release of Delta (referred to as "the app") will be maintained and patched in case
of any security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Posting on public channels like issues/discussions may cause bad actors to take advantage of
the vulnerabilities and thus, it is not advisable.

To report a vulnerability, mail @supershadoe through this [mail ID](mailto:security@shadoe.dev) and not through
any other channels.
