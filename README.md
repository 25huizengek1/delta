**Not developed any more**
As MAINLINE_NETWORK_STACK permission isn't granted to `com.android.shell` (adb),
there's no way to run `startTetheredHotspot()` function through Shizuku

Probably it can be used through Sui but idh any rooted device at hand to test,
so I'll just archive this project.

> Old README: This is an in-development app to create instant hotspots on stock Android with
more functionalities like a blocklist, timer for connections, usage limits, etc.
> Uses Compose for UI rendering and Android's Hotspot API.
