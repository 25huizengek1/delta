## delta

This is an in-development app to create hotspots on stock Android with
more functionalities like a blocklist, usage limits, etc.

This app can also trigger hotspot on devices like Samsung Tabs where tethering
is hidden from Settings app and SystemUI for Wi-Fi only devices.

App was tested on a Pixel 6A with Android 15, compatibility with other devices
is questionable at best as Android's internals change without a stable API.

The app is supposed to work on devices with Android >= 11 (R), feel free to file
an issue if it doesn't work as expected.

### How to use

Get the release APK from GitHub releases and install; also get Shizuku app
from Play Store.
